<h2>REMARKS.</h2>


<p>The title of this play gives a sensation of both pain
and pleasure.&mdash;Fontainbleau was a favourite residence
of a number of the French kings, and the spot where
the princes of the blood resorted, with all the nobility
of the land, when the sports of the field, or the course,
were the particular objects of their pastime. Pastime
is a word no longer used in the vocabulary of the
court of France&mdash;Every moment has now its impending
cares, and teems with the fate of empires!</p>

<p>At the time this opera was written, (in 1784) the late
Duke of Orleans frequently visited England, and was
remarkable for his passionate attachment to British
modes and manners. The character of Colonel Epaulette,
in this drama, was supposed to be founded on
this, his highness's extravagant partiality. There is
that trait, indeed, of the duke's propensity, in Epaulette;
but in all other respects, the colonel neither
soars, nor grovels, with his royal archetype, in any
one action of notoriety.</p>

<p>The author would not take the liberty to characterise
a foreigner, without dealing, at the same time,
equally free with one of his own countrymen. The
part of Lackland was taken more exactly from life,
than that of Epaulette, from a gentleman well known
abroad by every English traveller; and whose real
name is so very like the fictitious one here adopted,
that a single letter removed, would make the spelling
just the same.</p>

<p>The reader will observe in this Lackland, so much
of debased nature, and of whimsical art; so much
of what he has probably met with upon journeys, or
amongst common intruders at home, that he will regret,
that the author, in his delineation, swerves now
and then from that standard of truth, to which he,
possibly, at first meant to adhere; and for the sake of
dramatic effect, has made this hero, in effrontery, proceed
somewhat too far beyond its usual limits.</p>

<p>The family of the Bulls, especially Miss Bull and
her father, are likewise portraits rather too bold; but
they are humorous pictures, and, no doubt, perfect
copies of such citizens, as inhabited London a few
centuries past.</p>

<p>Squire Tallyho gives, like them, some idea of former
times; for his manners do not exactly correspond
with those of the modern gentlemen of the turf.</p>

<p>Lapoche is, perhaps, an exact Frenchman of the
time in which he was drawn; and, as such, the most
agreeable object for an Englishman's ridicule. The
mistakes which occur, to both Mr. and Mrs. Bull,
in respect to this insignificant, and that pompous man,
Epaulette, are incidents of very rich humour, though
they place the opera more in that class of the drama,
which is called farce, than in that of comedy. Such
is the incident, but more excellent in its kind, of
Lackland's courtship of Miss Dolly, and her equal
affection for her three suitors.</p>

<p>The real lovers, in this piece, would all be extremely
insipid, but that they all sing; and music is
called, "the voice of love."</p>

<p>When music had fewer charms for the British nation,
operas were required to possess more of interesting
fable than at present is necessary&mdash;for now, so rapturous
is the enjoyment derived from this enchanting
art, even by the vulgar, that plot, events, and characters
of genuine worth, would be cast away in a
production, where music had a share in bestowing
delight.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Come, Bob, what are you about, boy?
The company tumble in upon us like smoke; quick,
all the cooks at work, do you hear me now?</p>

<p><i>1 Waiter.</i> Yes, ma'am. Coming, coming.</p>
<p class="ralign">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Lackland.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] You scoundrel, I'll teach you
to talk to a gentleman!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Hey day!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Second <span class="smcap">Waiter</span>, stumbling in.</i></p>

<p class="noidt">What's the matter now?</p>

<p><i>2 Waiter.</i> Only Mr. Lackland, ma'am; you know
you ordered me to keep the Globe for the large company;
there, he takes possession of it; and though I
told him it was bespoke, he would dine no where
else:&mdash;orders a bottle of champagne, and because I
didn't fly with it, kicked me down stairs, though I
cried coming up, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Champagne, and not a Louis in his
pocket!&mdash;d'ye hear, tell Mr. Lackland, it's my desire
he'll quit my house.</p>

<p><i>2 Waiter.</i> Your desire! Ecod, ma'am, he said he'd
make you bounce.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Make me bounce! A shabby, spunging&mdash;&mdash;though
without a second coat, the fellow's as
proud as a Galway merchant.&mdash;Make me bounce in
my own house!&mdash;pretty well, that, upon my honour!</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] What! house!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Run, don't you hear?</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> [<i>Within.</i>] Where is that infernal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>2 Waiter.</i> Infernal! that's you, ma'am, he's calling.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Hush! here he is. [<i>Exit Second <span class="smcap">Waiter</span>.</i>]
Because I'm a lone woman, he thinks to impose
upon the house.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Lackland</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Landlady, your attendance is shameful!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Why, the truth is, sir, my waiters have
enough to do if they properly attend on folks who
have money to pay for what they call for.</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Takes out her Snuff Box.</i></p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> [<i>Takes a Pinch.</i>] And even your snuff, is execrable!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Lookye, Mr. Lackland, that you're a
gentleman every body knows; and you've a good
estate, only it's all gone; and you're allowed to be a
six bottle man, and a choice companion. Ah! the
beginning of a good song at the latter end of a bottle
is a capital thing for a house&mdash;Now, here, during the
race time, I'll give you your board at the table d'h&ocirc;te,
and money in your pocket to pay the reckoning, if
you'll only be a good jolly fellow, and encourage the
company to drink, by a funny song, or a comical
story.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> What! live by entertaining a company?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Yes; that's what I call earning your
bread like a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Make me your decoy-duck? Mrs. Casey,
you're a widow, you'll oblige me if you'll marry somebody
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> And why so, pray?</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Madam, that I might have the superlative
honour of twisting your husband by the nose.</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Bows gravely.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Well, upon my honour, you're a very
mannerly fellow! but I wish I had a husband, for your

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Gagger</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Gag.</i> Madam, there's a Paris chaise stopped, and
the master of the Lily of France has got hold of them
already.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Casey.</i> Then he shall soon quit his hold, that
he shall, as sure as my name is Casey.&mdash;Bob, do you
go and try to bring them this way, and I'll go see the
rooms prepared myself. [<i>Goes to the Door.</i>] Ah,
my dearee, I wish I had a husband!</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> What d'ye mean? Oh, my&mdash;[<i>Looking at his

or sunshine.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Why, 'faith, Lackland, as to cash, my affairs,
at present, are little better than your own.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Ahem! Egad, that's rather unlucky for us
both.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> But my mind, my dear Charles! I am this
moment the most unhappy&mdash;in a word, you see me
here an exile, fled from the hands of justice!&mdash;You
remember my sister Rosa?</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> What, little romping Rose, that used to steal
our fish, and throw our cards in the fire? Eh, did I
dream, or wasn't there a match talked of, between
her and Lord Winlove?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> All over, my dear Lackland! guided only
by the weakness of her sex, and the art of ours, she
was prevailed on by Lord Winlove to take the road to
the Continent; I overtook them at Rochester,
demanded reparation of my sister's character by an instant
marriage&mdash;I was violent&mdash;my lord's pride, hurt
at a charge, which, perhaps, he did not deserve&mdash;a
pistol was the umpire&mdash;he lost his life, and, in apprehension
that a verdict might endanger mine, I was
compelled to assume the disguise of a woman, to effect
my escape.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Bravo! shot a lord! I wing'd a marquis
yesterday&mdash;poor Rosa! where is she now?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I have lodged her in the convent of Villeneuve.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> And have taken the races of Fontainbleau
in your way back to Paris?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I'll tell you frankly, though you'll say, rather
inconsistent with my present situation; I'm drawn
hither purely by the hopes of meeting an amiable
young lady, who engaged my conversation at the
Sunday opera, in Paris.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Her name?&mdash;Good family, eh?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I'm a total stranger to both&mdash;talks of her
brother's having horses to run, and of their intention
of being there at the races.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> La, papa, let's have no piping here!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Pipes! what man, d'ye think you're at
Dobney's bowling-green?</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> Consider, we are now at Fontainbleau,

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> Thank you, daughter, but I'm not quite

<p><i>Lady B.</i> But, consider, my dear, if Colonel Epaulette
does us the honour of a visit, how he'll be shocked
at your appearance!</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> Thank you, thank you, wife; but I don't
think I'm quite so shocking.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Then, if he does introduce us to the

sent for one Mr. Lapoche, a celebrated French tailor,

Throgmorton Street?</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i>Oh, pray don't let my presence disconcert
any body&mdash;Ladies, I dined with my friend Tallyho,
and Colonel Epaulette; the colonel understanding
that I admitted Sir John here, to some share of my
notice, begged I'd make his respects, and that he'd wait
on you immediately.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Now, Miss Bull, summon all the graces.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> Oh, lud! and the powder's all&mdash;the

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> Bull! I will not be seated.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Yes, she is a fine girl, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> Who, Doll? Yes, Doll's a dev'lish fine
girl, and I shall give fourscore thousand pounds with
her.</p>

such a vulgar family!&mdash;Hearkye&mdash;pray&mdash;[<i>With

say, whether ornaments grace the person, or the person
ornaments the dress.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> He's vastly well bred, mamma.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Yes, but speaks English too plain for a
gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Miss Bull's spirit and good humour, is the
emblem of English liberty, and your ladyship, [<i>Bows.</i>]

<p><i>Lack.</i> I presume, ladies, you go to the ball to-night&mdash;if

Squire Tallyho?</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> True, papa; but then, I hadn't seen

you?</p>

the colonel&mdash;he mayn't like me, and, perhaps, I
mayn't like him.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Dolly, you're too ready with your yes.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Consider, if your ladyship had always cruelly
said no, Miss Dolly could never have been the
admiration of the Court of Versailles.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> Yes, and I dare say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Softly, my honest fellow.</p>

out of my slips&mdash;twice at Hackney boarding school&mdash;I
don't reckon my guitar-master&mdash;then Frank
Frippery&mdash;Mr. Pettitoe&mdash;No, sir, only eight, for I

why scamper off, sir, when I'm sure mamma would
consent?</p>

<p><i>Colonel E.</i> Oui, consent&mdash;but dat is so mechanique!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> True, sir, it does sound of Bow bell;
and, as you say, scampering off is such a funny thing,
he! he! he!&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Ecod, I've a great mind, if I
should, how Squire Tallyho would be surprised!</p>

'twas for that I came here to meet him.</p>

I get you over into Yorkshire, we'll be married over

Thump?</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> Lord, Squire, don't tell me of Parson

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> I was laughing, to think of our marriage.</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> I begin to think, marriage is no laughing matter,
Doll&mdash;now, I tell you truly, I like you as well as
any thing I ever saw&mdash;Good points&mdash;fancy, thirteen
hands high, and, by my lady's account, rising nineteen
years last grass&mdash;but I tell you some things you must
learn, to be my wife.&mdash;My mother, you must know,
was a fine lady, all upon the hoity-toities, and so, good
for nothing&mdash;Says father to me, one evening, as the
last whiff of his fourth pipe sighed to the tears of the
third tankard&mdash;Gaby, my dear boy, never marry a
woman that can't breakfast on beef&mdash;carve a goose&mdash;won't
withdraw from table, before "King and constitution,"
and sing a jolly song at first bidding&mdash;and
then, says he, [<i>Snores.</i>] take care o'the girls, Gaby&mdash;and
dropping asleep&mdash;yes, father, says I, I'll take care
o'the girls&mdash;and with that, I slipped a brace of yellow
boys out of his purse, and, next day, bought Peggy
Trundle, the housemaid, a pair of Bath garters, silver
shoe-buckles, and a marquisate pin, for her stomacher,
he! he! he!</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> I shouldn't ha' thought of your entertaining
me with your old father's pipe, and Peggy
Trundle's stomachers&mdash;if you're come here to run away
with me, why, do the thing at once, and let's
have no more talk about it.</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> True, Doll, such a fortune as yours, don't offer
every day&mdash;I've a chaise at the door, and a sulky
for Father Dominic, and, as your dad may be
for pursuing us, I won't depend upon those rascally
French postboys&mdash;it's all crack, smack, jabber, grin,
and bustle&mdash;great noise, and little work, with them&mdash;No,

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> Yes, and now, you may canter off to
Newmarket.</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> Lackland, I give you joy of little Ginger, for
she was never good, egg, or bird.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Colonel Epaulette</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Colonel E.</i> How do you, good folks, damme? Ah,
Miss Dolly coquin, run away!</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolly B.</i> Yes, Colonel, and didn't even wait
for my dancing pumps!</p>

<p><i>Colonel E.</i> How is my good Lady de Bull? zounds!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Sir, if you're a Frenchman, behave like
one.</p>

<p><i>Colonel E.</i> I vill never behave myself, damme!</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> Oh, Captain, you made the betts against my
mare&mdash;when do we share, my Trojan?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Sir, I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> Why, didn't I pay forfeit, and let the colonel's
Black Prince walk over the course to-day?</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> And, seriously, did you dare to think that
I'd join in such a scandalous affair?</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> Then you may fling your cap at Celia.</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> Hush! you laid me five thousand yourself&mdash;consent
to my marriage with your sister, or I'll
proclaim you, not only here, at Fontainbleau, but at
every racecourse in England.</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> I'm had&mdash;yes, and tricked, choused, slanged,
and banged! Celia, take him against the field&mdash;clever&mdash;has
nicked me, that have nicked hundreds!</p>

<p><i>Henry.</i> I fancy, the first real good ever produced
by gaming; our winning is but a decoy, its joys, built
upon the grief of others, and our losses stop but in ruin,
or dishonour.</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> May be so; but, as I set out a young pigeon,
I'll die an old rook.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> But how shall I get this rook [<i>To <span class="smcap">Lackland</span>.</i>]
out of my pigeon-house?</p>

<p><i>Colonel E.</i> Ah, pauvre Lackland! I ave procure
de commission for you, in my regiment.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Thank you, Colonel, but while I can raise
the price of a drumstick, I'll never draw a sword
against my country.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> What!&mdash;your hand, my Briton!&mdash;you
shall never want a nail for your hat, in my parlour,
at dinner time&mdash;you shall post my books, and take
the whip hand of my lady's gig on a Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Drive a gig! My dear dad, you shall rattle
up in your vis-a-vis, to the astonishment of all Garlick
Hill.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> My dearee and I ride, side by side, in a
vis-a-vis! ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Tall.</i> Yes, and if you whip your gig down to
Yorkshire, I'll mount her ladyship upon Whirligig,
and, Sir Jackey, my lad, up you go again upon Kick-him-Jenny.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. B.</i> I'll see you astride the dragon, upon Bow
steeple first&mdash;but now I'll invite you all to the British
Lion, where French claret shall receive the zest of
English hospitality&mdash;Eh, my Antigallican son-in-law?</p>

<p><i>Lack.</i> Well said, Bull; but mind, I'll have no illiberal
prejudices in my family&mdash;general national reflections,
are unworthy the breast of an Englishman;
and, however in war, each may vindicate his country's
honour, in peace, let us not know a distance, but the
Streights of Dover.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
